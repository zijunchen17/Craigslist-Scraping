When Company is awarded projects, BIM Coordinator would attend meetings with general contractors and their respective subcontractors to discuss BIM requirements for the project and agree on expectations. Following this BIM Coordinator will take the base drawings (blueprints) which have been designed by the architects and use them to create a BIM model. The components of this model will be related to the drywall and/or ceiling work performed by the Company. e.g. Stud walls, acoustical ceilings & ceiling components, hanging details etc. ", "\nWeekly BIM coordination meetings are generally held at the jobsite as the virtual model is being created to coordinate with other trades on the job and solve any problems that arise. The software that is typically used is from Autodesk & normally includes BIM 360, BIM Glue, Navisworks, Revit & AutoCAD. At these meetings, the models which the other respective trades (plumbing, sprinkler, HVAC etc.) have created alongside the BIM Coordinator\u2019s models, are combined into one to reflect the physical job buildout. Clash detection tests are run to determine potential points of conflict between, for example, critical members of walls & sprinkler pipes. ", "\nFollowing these meetings, BIM Coordinator will typically need to update models to reflect solutions developed to avoid clashes with other trades equipment & material. This process is an iterative one & normally lasts several months to fine tune the model before construction on site can commence. The main purpose of this entire process is to ensure smooth & efficient running of the actual project buildout once it has commenced, minimizing any delays & problems, thus saving both time and money for clients. ", "\nOnce the project has commenced, BIM Coordinator will meet with the Company Foreman & Project Manager at the job site to discuss the plan that has been agreed to build out the job. Examples of this might include explaining & showing drawings of some ceiling framing alterations Company must make at a particular location to avoid a clash with ductwork running overhead. Another example could be moving the adjusting the stud spacing for a section of wall to accommodate a sprinkler main. As the job progresses, BIM Coordinator remains available to the foreman for any questions they may have throughout the project lifecycle to ensure it runs smoothly as far as BIM Coordinator\u2019s scope of work is concerned. ", "\nBIM Coordinator must design & draw up various details of components the Company would then physically construct at projects. Software used here would include AutoCAD & Revit to design and represent the details. Examples include knife edges/light coves, specialty ceiling designs & framing details, ramps, platforms, hanging/mounting details for fabric panels etc. The details required vary often by project. These designs then must be submitted to the architect who designed the project and approved by them which allows the Company to then physically construct per the approved detail BIM Coordinator has created. ", "\nDepending on the complexity of the detail, BIM Coordinator will sometimes need to visit the foreman on site to explain the detail the design intention including how it was created by BIM Coordinator.", "\nCoupled with the duties above, the Company has weekly meetings to discuss project progress which BIM Coordinator typically takes part in. Involvement in these meetings normally includes providing approximate milestone dates such when BIM Coordinators thinks a project buildout will begin (so foremen and workers can be scheduled ahead of time), updating the accounting department on the percentage of work complete to date and discussing general company goals.", "\nDaily supervision of one (1) CAD Technician.
